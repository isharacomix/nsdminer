NSDMiner determines network service dependencies by analyzing flows of network
traffic that are either collected from routers (using Cisco NetFlow records) or
created from individual packets (using softflowd). This package provides the
NSDMiner core tool, along with a frontend that makes it possible to provide
input in various file formats, such as pcap files.

To use NSDMiner, first install our modified version of softflowd (use
'./configure && make && sudo make install'). After softflowd is installed,
install NSDMiner using 'sudo python setup.py install'. Softflowd requires
libpcap-dev to compile.

In addition to installing the frontend nsdmine, the nsdminer python package
will also be installed, allowing a user to work with the data structure
representing the dependency graph on their own, giving them fine-grained control
over how it is processed.

If pcap files are provided as input, then intermediary flow files will be
automatically saved in a "flows" subdirectory in the current working
directory. These flows can be provided in subsequent runs of NSDMiner to speed
up dependency calculations.


Usage:
    nsdmine [options] infiles...
    
    Options:
        --memlimit=N    The number of flows to track at a given time. Is 100000000 by
                        default, but may need to be set lower on constrained machines
        
        --exclusive     Use the exclusive mode heuristic and drop conflicting flows
        
        --alpha=A       Filter all dependencies with a confidence value <A
                        A should be a positive integer between 1 and 100
        
        --minlimit=N    The minimum number of accesses required to track dependencies
                        for a service. Default 50.
        
        --ratio         Use the original ratio-based ranking (less accurate)
        
        --infer=S,A     Use inference with similarity and agreement parameters S,A
                        S and A should be positive integers between 1 and 100.
                        Lower values will increase true positive detection,
                        but also false positives. 50 for both is generally
                        reasonable.
        
        --clusters=S,A  Use clustering with support and alpha threshold S,A
                        S should be a positive integer, usually around 5 to 10.
                        A should be a positive integer between 1 and 100, less than --alpha
        
        --filter=ips..  Only track dependencies from IP addresses in the filter.
                        Should be a comma-separated list of partial IP addresses.
                        --filter=127.,192. will include all of 127.* and 192.*
        
        --pcap          Read from a sequence of pcap files rather than flow files.
                        This option requires the use of softflowd. The flows will
                        be saved in the current directory, in a new subdirectory
                        called "flows".

        --cisco         Read from a sequence of Cisco v5 netflows, converting the
                        binary records to ascii flows, saving them in a new directory
                        called "flows".
                        NOTE: THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL -- I haven't had a chance to test
                                                      this yet!

    The infiles should be a chronologically-ordered list of either pcap files
    (when using option --pcap) or ascii flow records formatted in the following
    way:
    
start_time  end_time  duration  protocol  src_ip  src_port  dest_ip  dest_port  src_flags  dst_flags  no_packets  no_octets  direction
    start_time          UNIX start time
    end_time            UNIX end time
    duration            end_time - start_time
    protocol            TCP or UDP
    src_ip              Source IP address
    src_port            Source port
    dest_ip             Destination IP address
    dest_port           Destination port
    src_flags           TCP Flags for the outbound flow. A string of 6 characters,
                        with a period '.' if false and a letter if True.
                            U - URG
                            A - ACK
                            P - PSH
                            R - RST
                            S - SYN
                            F - FIN
                        So a flow that had the SYN and ACK flags set would
                        read ".A..S.".
    dest_flags          TCP Flags for the inbound flow
    no_packets          Number of packets
    no_octects          Total number of bytes send
    direction           1 if a one-way flow (src -> dest)
                        2 if bidirectional (src <-> dest)
    
    Parameters are seperated by whitespace with one flow record on each line.


Output:
    The output of NSDMiner is a dependency graph, written in ASCII and written
    to stdout, formatted as follows:    
    
<ip address A>:<port A>:[TCP/UDP] <# instances>
    <ip address B>      <port B> [TCP/UDP]      <confidence B>
    <ip address C>      <port C> [TCP/UDP]      <confidence C>
    ...                 ...                     ...
    <ip address Z>      <port Z> [TCP/UDP]      <confidence Z>
    
    
    This output says that service A (that runs on ip address A on port A)
    depends on services B through Z which run on their respective machines and
    ports. The dweight shows how many times that the service flow appeared
    within the flow of service A.
